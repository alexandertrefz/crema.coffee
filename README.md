crema.coffee
============

Crema - MVC-like framework for CoffeeScript

THIS FRAMEWORK IS NOT UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

According to the unit tests it is bug free, but since it has no Documentation and wont receive any Documentation any time soon, I suggest you use a different MVC framework like Backbone. It will most likely suit your needs better then this one anyway.
